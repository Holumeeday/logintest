        <p style="padding: 7px;">The herds of animal rearers were usually large and the herders drove the cattle to wherever they would get food and also trade in the products. In places where the occupation was well established, the supply of cattle was usually high.
          One feature which distinguished animal rearers from others was their nomadic nature. They move from place to place in search of pasture and water. It was mainly the scarcity of pasture for animals that always kept them on the move in search of greener pastures. Except in full migrations where the pastoralists moved to a new area, the movement, usually from their homes in the Sahara margins to the Savannah, and up to areas below the Niger.

        <p  style="padding: 7px;">Animal husbandry was important in the savannah. It was difficult to rear herds in the south because of lack of pasture. Secondly, tsetse flies posed a great menace to the animals. Unlike in the south where there are no professional rearers, the cattle herders in the savannah were famous for the milk, butter, and skins which they provided. Like farming, cattle rearing depended on family labour, each pastoral family minding its own cattle. They are nomadic in nature.
